webpack will automatically split chunks based on these conditions:

New chunk can be shared OR modules are from the node_modules folder（共享 or node_modules）
New chunk would be bigger than 30kb (before min+gz)（大于30kb）
Maximum number of parallel requests when loading chunks on demand would be lower or equal to 5（页面加载文件数少于5）
Maximum number of parallel requests at initial page load would be lower or equal to 3
